# 🎓 Attendance Request Management Portal

A full-stack web application built entirely with **Next.js (App Router)** that digitizes the attendance request process for students engaged in extracurricular activities. It simplifies and automates multi-level approval from Class Teachers and HODs, replacing the traditional paper-based system.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Students involved in extracurricular activities need to apply for attendance concessions via printed applications, which is:
- Time-consuming and inefficient (Waiting outside HOD Cabin for the Sign)
- Prone to loss of data or errors
- Hard to track and manage

This portal replaces the manual system with a streamlined digital process involving submission, tracking, and approval workflows — all in one place.
